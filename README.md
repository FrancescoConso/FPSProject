The password is "revolver", all lowercase.

I intially started this project to play around with the engine and see its potential to develop a shooter game, over time I developed the idea of a Doom-style shooter. As featured started to come up to my mind I ended with a prototype that, while working, has its fair share of imperfections, bugs and most of all optimization troubles. I think it's best to start new with all the knowledge I acquired working on this prototype. So in the meantime I have uploaded the work so far, with all its content, flaws and placeholder assets.

Enjoy the work!
